# Dune Character Explorer

**Dune Character Explorer** is an interactive web app built with Streamlit that allows you to explore, filter, and visualize characters from Frank Herbert's Dune universe. With this app, you can analyze the distribution of characters by house, book, or culture, view character details, and (soon) explore their relationships and story timelines.

Its purpose is to practice and demonstrate skills in data visualization, Python development, and building interactive web applications using Streamlit.

The Dune Character Explorer app is a hands-on exercise to:
- Structure a professional data science code repository
- Visualize real-world, non-tabular data (network, timeline, etc.)
- Build user-friendly data exploration tools for popular fiction datasets
